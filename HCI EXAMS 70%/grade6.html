 <h1><u>SYSTEM DESIGN </u></h1> <br>
<h1>LOGIN PAGE

	<P>The above interface consist of the login page which requires authentication to access the administrator page and a button to get access to the seller page which requires no authentication The login page is where you'll complete your authentication.
The system must verify that the individual accessing or logging into the administrator page is authorized to do so.
This is done to secure the system from unauthorized users.The three evaluation inspired the design of the semi circle on the login page and the colours used for the system

<h1>ADMINISTRATOR PAGE <br>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 borderStyle noRightBorder">
        <div class="project">

        </div>
	</h1>
	<p>From the the three evaluations done (paper prototyping, heuristic
evaluation, and user testing). we were able to produce the above design for the administrator. The admin needed a simple and easy interface to work with
looking at the number of interfaces to be controlled by the admin. The interface needed to be implemented simple to reduce the stress of multiple buttons and features.
The interface leads to the sales, adding of category to shop, products and total sale and expenditure in days or months all found in the dashboard features.

    </div><br>
	<h1>SELLER PAGE
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4 borderStyle noRightBorder noLeftRadius">
        <div class="project">

        </div><br>
	</h1>
	<p>From the evaluation decision has be made to arrive at the above design for the seller page. Here the user is given access to the page to sell products which will be deducted from the inventory.
    A print feature has been added to print receipt or items bought by the customer and keep records of sales. The three evaluations motivated us to add the print feature and update the colours on the system.

					<P>The data collected from the system is used to generate point of sale (POS) reports.
Data and activities from the register are tracked at a point of sale terminal, which retains information that may be analyzed via POS reports.
Retailers can benefit from this POS study such as
revenue Monitoring. The three analysis brought to birth this feature</P>

<u><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1> </u>
<p>In order to execute this program smoothly, this project required a machine with high specifications.
Before gaining access to the system, the user must first obtain internet services.
The user must have a password-protected user account.</p>


<!-- End Portfolio -->

<u><h1>EVALUATION</h1></u>
<p>The test was conducted as quick as ever in other not to engage the users time for long. Random representatives were found on campus, some were students in their first years and others were in their second year.
  There were introductions and briefing of users as to what tasks to accomplish. Cards were handed over to users with task to complete and they were able to go through without any guide what so ever.Sme problems include
  user feedback were not given when an update is done or data is entered into the system. Introducing confirmation sound into the system will give users feedback anytime data is sent to the system.
<u><h1>REFLECTION</h1></u>
<p>According on the iteration process, we discovered that users can move back and forth within the system and accomplish whatever work they desire.
Users may find it challenging to utilize the system if they have not been properly taught.
For example, if a system administrator does not receive adequate training, he or she may struggle to fulfill his or her responsibilities.
