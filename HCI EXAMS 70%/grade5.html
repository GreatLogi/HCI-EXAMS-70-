<h1>About POS SYSTEM with Inventoy AND bIlling</h1>
<p>Your firm may collect payments from customers and keep track of sales with a POS system. It appears simple enough, but depending on whether you sell online, have a physical storefront, or both, the arrangement can operate in a variety of ways.
	 The cash register in a store is referred to as a point-of-sale system.The term point of sale refers to the moment a transaction is made between a consumer and business. This can occur in-person at a brick-and-mortar retail location, or it can occur online through an e-commerce outlet.
 POS systems can consist of both hardware and software components.
 This can include credit card readers, cash registers, barcode scanners, and payment processing software—we’ll touch more on these components below.</p>

 <h1>Purpose of the POS system</h1><br>
 <h1>Sales reporting</h1>
 <p>POS systems are a helpful tool for tracking the performance of your business. POS software can track important business metrics and produce reports that gauge your financial health.
Modern POS systems enable you to run reports that will help you make informed business decisions. These reports can leverage sales data that will help you optimize your business operations and streamline a path to profitability.
Reporting features can help you determine which products are selling, what your margins are, and how much money you make from month to month. In this day a</p>

<h1>Inventory management</h1>
<p>Inventory management features are a must-have for any company that sells products. POS systems can assist you in keeping track of which products are coming in and which are leaving.
The top point-of-sale systems will allow you to set reminders to remind you when it's the perfect time to restock goods. Some systems even allow you to create automatic purchase orders that will order new inventory when the quantity of a specific product reaches a given level.</p>

<h1>Customer relationship management</h1>
<p>Customer management and data tracking are excellent ways to increase brand loyalty for your company. POS systems can save data that helps you build a stronger relationship with your consumers.
For starters, you can provide discounts to repeat consumers or create a customer loyalty program. Customers will return to your business more frequently as a result of more positive and personalized experiences.
	After a transaction, you can utilize your POS system to communicate with customers. You can start sending promotional emails to your consumers if they opt in to receive email marketing communications. Customers can communicate with some POS systems, while others will not.</p>
	<h1>Employee management</h1>
	<p>POS systems can also help your business manage your relationship with your employees. If you have several employees working for you, you’ll need to track their hours, sales commissions, and distribution of tips.
Employees will be clocking in and clocking out for every shift they work.
 Not only can your POS system let employees clock in and out on their own,
 but you can also set work schedules through your POS software.
You’ll also need to track employee commissions for completed sales and employee tip distribution.
Commissions and tips can be fairly distributed to all your employees based on unique identifiers in your system.</p>
