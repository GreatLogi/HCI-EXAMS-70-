<h1> <u> About Us </u> 
<p>Fashion is a form of self expression, at a particular period and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle,
 accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture.
 In its everyday use, the term implies a look defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. What is called fashion 
 is thus that which is made available and popular by fashion system (industry and media).
In reaction to increased mass-production of commodities clothing at lower prices and global reach, sustainability has become an urgent issue among politicians, brands,
 and consumers.
 Fashion designers are creative, innovative and determined individuals having knowledge and awareness of the fashion market requirements.
 Fashion designers have to be interested in learning new things and reading journals, magazines, and books on fashion design history and new trends. 
 The profession of fashion designing involves a set of skills that range from market research and creativity to sketching and fabric selection. 
 It is a profession that requires designers to constantly be in tune with market trends. To be successful, 
 fashion designers must have a good understanding of the audience's lifestyle, customer needs and requirements.</p>
