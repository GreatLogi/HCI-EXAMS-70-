      Group Project

      <p><u> Point of Sale (POS) System for Judia PZ Provision Store</u><br></p>

    </h1>
    <p>
      <p><u><br><br>Problem Statement</u><br></p>
      The problem statement below was derived from a field analysis of a shop and consent was seeked by the owner of the shop to use her name
      in various use cases of the project. Find attached the evidence of the chat conducted between the owner and a member of the group.<br><br>

      Cashiers at Judia PZ Provision Store sell a multitude of products in a store. They have no software inventory to check for products status whether its available or not.
      The manager Ms. Lydia  is not always available to supervise the hired cashiers and siblins who sell the provisions at the shop so mostly they take records in a book which is not efficient
      for stock keeping. From the problem above she states that she has no idea if the cashiers are stealing her or the products are been sold on dept. Therefore her goal is to
      to keep track of all products in the store which includes product sold and bought a daily, weekly and the amount of money in the register.
      Field analysis was made to get to experience the problem Ms. Lydia is facing, we were able to conclude that she needed a point of sale system to manage he store. Below are a summary of the goals to be achieved at the end of the project.
        <ul>
      <li>a) Keeping an eye on the remaining stock</li>
      <li>b) Upgrading the inventory (i.e., increase the product quantities when new stock arrives)</li>
      <li>c) Changing the prices of specific products.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>

  <p><u><br><br>User Analysis</u><br></p>
    The goal of user analysis is to determine which characteristics of the user may have an impact on the interface design.
    By "task," we imply the work that the user desires to complete while using the interface, as well as any connected goals.<br>
    <br>
    The User of the system are as follows;<br>
    <ul>
      <li>I.Employees </li>
      <li>II. Manager</li><br>
      Characteristics of the Manager;<br>

      <li>I. Manager can add stocks</li>
      <li>II. Manager can/will update stocks</li>
      <li>III. Manager can/will delete stocks</li>
      <li>IV. Manager can/will create administrator account</li>
      <li>V. Manager can/will delete administrator accounts</li>
      <br>

      Characteristics of the Employees <br>
      <li>I. Employees will perform details operation by selling stocks</li>
      <li>II. Employees will accept payment either cash or credit card or Debit Card </li>
      <br>
      Summary:
      <br>
      Provide users with access to administrative system services.<br>

      <p><u><br><br>Task Analysis</u><br></p>
    At any time, the store Point of sale System must be able to serve concurrent requests from all POSTs that are active.
    Stock management capabilities should be available at the same time as sales recording. <br>
    The ordering of goods to replenish the stock is also addressed in this project.<br>
    <li>I. The store will have a set amount of goods in stock for each product sold. </h1>
    <li>II. Additional quantities will be purchased if the stock falls below a certain threshold.</li>
    <li>III. In this project, we will not keep track of orders, but we will provide the following stock operations:
Inquire about a product's remaining quantity, obtain a list of all low-stock goods (below the threshold), increase a product's quantity when new stock arrives, and alter a product's price.</li>
    <li>IV. The list of product identifiers is pre-populated at startup (only product quantities and pricing are permitted to change). </li>
    <li>V. A well implemented seamless database will be created to serve the system.</li>

    <h1>USE CASE DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <li>Use Case Name: Login</li><br>
    <h1>Summary:</h1>
    Provides managers with access to administrative system services.<br>
    <li>Actor: Manager</li>
    <h1>Prerequisites:</h1>
    The system has been successfully started.

Currently, the Point of Service Terminal is dormant.

The manager inserts a unique username and password identification into the Keypad, which is verified by the system.

The System double-checks which features this user has access to.

The System shows the user the available capability on the Display.
    Alternatives:
    An error notice is given if the number is invalid.
    If the Store Server fails, an error notice appears and no extra functionality is available.
    If the Database Server fails, an error notice appears and no extra functionality is available.

    <h1> Post Condition:</h1>
    The Point of Service Terminal is now ready for additional activities.

    <li>Use Case description: Sell Product</li>
    <li> Case Name: Sell Product</li>
    <li> A product is sold</li>
    <li> Sale Assistant </li>
    <h1> Prerequisites</h1>
    I. The System has now been successfully launched.
    II. The POS Terminal is inactive, with a ready message displayed on the display.




    <b>Description</b>
    The name, price, default number of items, and total price of that product are displayed on the display and printed on the receipt. After scanning the item, the corresponding sales taxes (9% and 11%) are computed, displayed on the display, and
    printed on the receipt.
    <h1>
      Alternatives:
    </h1>
    If there are multiple identical items to be purchased, the sales assistant scans one of them and uses the keypad to enter the total number of identical items. If the item is not found in the database, an error message appears on the display. If
    communication with the Store Server is lost, an error message appears on the display, and no sales or commitments can be made.
    If the Store Server's database fails, an error message3 appears on the screen, and no sales or commitments may be made.
    If the customer is unable to pay the total amount owing, the sales assistant will end the session and no modifications to the System Database will be performed.
    <h1>
      Post Condition:
    </h1>
    For each item sold, the Store Server has been updated.<br>
